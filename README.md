# Reddit Saved Viewer

## Motivation

I save a lot of stuff for viewing at later date when I'm browsing reddit. However, it can sometimes be a pain to scroll
miles and miles to view everything. This React app helps view all the saved content in a digestible way.

Also, this project is for to learn and utilise React for the first time.

## Built with (so far)
