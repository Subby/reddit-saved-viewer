# Reddit Saved Viewer

## Motivation

I save a lot of stuff for viewing at later date when I'm browsing reddit. However, it can sometimes be a pain to scroll
miles and miles to view everything. This React app helps view all the saved content in a digestible way.

Also, this project is mainly for me to learn about and to utilise React for the first time.

## Features
* View **all** your saved content
* Apply filters to find the stuff you're looking for easily. Filtering includes:
    * Submission type filters (posts or comments)
    * NSFW/SFW filters
    * Search filter
    * Subreddit filter


## Built with
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Snoowrap](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/snoowrap)
