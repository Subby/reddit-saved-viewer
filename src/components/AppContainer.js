up guys,\n\nBeen a long-time follower of the dating advice industry \n\nThere's a real trend of guys who misinterpreting the advice of \"don't chase women\". \n\n\"Just chase your championship and the girl will chase the champion.\" \"Queens are looking for kings.\" These guys will do everything under the sun to make himself more attractive to women **besides** actually going up and talking to a woman. I need 8.0% body fat before a girl will like me, I need to make $100k a year, I need to have passionate hobbies, friends, a fucking dog and then **the women will approach me**. \n\nNip this in the bud. Now. This thought process is dangerous because it robs you of your proactivity. It's another form of rationalization, and comes between you and the opportunity to meet women.\n\nYou should absolutely do all the things to improve your health, make a better lifestyle for yourself, and find what you're passionate about. But don't hold these as an excuse to not take action! You will end up realizing at the end that while you were doing all of these things, someone who was willing to take action will RUN CIRCLES around you! A mediocre guy who takes massive action will run circles around a great guy who takes little action.\n\nLet me tell a story to illustrate. We have guy A, Six-Pack Saul and we have guy B Approach Alex.\n\n Saul is committed to his fitness grind, financial grind, career/purpose; all very attractive to a woman. Saul works out in the gym 6 days a week, counts his macros, and has shredded six-pack abs. He also works hard at his day job as a financial analyst at a top bank, and makes great money money. He's a good guy; all of his friends like him and has had a girlfriend or two. He's a solid dude who has a lot going for him and a lot of women would love to date, talk and hook up with him. \n\nBut Saul believes some A) approaching women is **weird** B) if you get a six-pack, make a lot of money, drive a nice car,etc women **should** recognize **your value** and if they **don't** they're \"dumb whores\" or something or C) believes the woo woo bullshit that you need to engineer your body's testosterone or align you masculine chakra with the polar vortex and the girls will be sucked your gravitational field or some shit... So he rarely approachs.\n\nHe is **reactive** to the world; waiting for the world to come along and plop a woman in his lap. He will go out dressed very well, hanging out with his buddies or coworkers, and sit there and wait. An attractive woman might see him, be attracted, and smile at him; inviting him to come talk to her. She might even approach if he's insanely good looking, appearance of high status... but it's not likely. But A,B,C get in the way. \n\nThen there is Approach Alex.\n\nAlex is not the greatest guy. He works some menial jobs as an Uber driver, that don't pay well and doesn't have much motivation to improve himself. He plays video games and lives at home with his parents. He doesn't go to the gym that often, and when he does it's very inconsistent as a result he just looks average. He doesn't take that good of care of himself; unkept clothes, and when he talks to girls he can be offensive, rude and crass because it makes him laugh.\n\n But Alex does have two qualities: proactivity and raw persistence. When he goes out, if he sees a woman he wants to talk to, he approaches. He will approach any girl who is attractive to him. This includes girls who are out with other guys, girls in groups, girls who are \"off-limits\". He just doesn't care. And he's not concerned about ABC.\n\nAlex will absolutely RUN CIRCLES around Saul in terms of how many women he will meet and will have his choice from. \n\nBack to the bar example...At a similar bar where there are let's say twenty attractive women.\n\nSaul stands in the corner...waiting for women to approach him. The receptive women shoot him plenty of glances and invite him to talk to them... but he still thinks he shouldn't \"chase\" women. That they should come to him. So he waits. And hey, one of them does actually approach him because she thinks he's good looking. And so they talk to each-other and he gets her number. Success... right?\n\nSaul follows up the next day, and it turns out she barely remembers him. She was drunk so she had the confidence to come up and talk to him, but doesn't really remember the details of the conversation and deletes his number or just doesn't answer his follow up text. Not good.\n\nAlex walks in and immediately sees a girl he's interested in talking to. He approaches within three seconds and she starts out initially neutral to him, but she doesn't like him for how polarizing he is and actually tells him she doesn't like him. But Alex doesn't care. He's not reactive to what the girl thinks about him. He's just acting on his desire to meet women without the bullshit excuse in his head of why he can't get out there and approach.\n\n He's unfazed by the interaction. Alex will repeat this with 7 more girls as he's out to just meet, interact, and pick between his options. And on the 7th girl, she was neutral towards him when he first approached, but she became attracted to him based off how she made him feel and general solid game. She is sexually attracted to him and because Alex is **proactive** he takes her home and sleeps with her.\n\nThis effect multiplies on itself and it will get to a point where Approach Alex will have more girls than he knows what to do with. While Saul will likely cling to few girls that approach him and won't have his choice of women.\n\nThe moral of the story is take massive action! You absolutely should continuously improve yourself and improve your lifestyle but not at the expense of taking action.

And you’re going to learn how to do this in a way that will help you hook up with attractive women consistently (without being creepy).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##Use Kino Escalation To Get The Girl\n\n&nbsp;\n\nKino escalation isn’t something you do to a girl. It’s more like a dance that you and a girl do together. However, women will rarely lead this dance, so you must take the lead.\n\nWhen you touch a girl, she will respond in one of three ways: positively, neutrally, or negatively. If she responds positively, you can take that as a green light to touch her more intimately.\n\nIf she responds neutrally or negatively, you should take a step back and allow her to get more comfortable with you before re-initiating.\n\nFor reference, here’s what a positive, neutral, and negative response looks like:\n\n-Positive response: When you touch her, she touches you back or leans in towards you. (You can see an example of a positive response in this hidden camera video- https://youtu.be/OhmTUyDZc6M?t=398)\n\n-Neutral response: When you touch her, she doesn’t push you away, but she doesn’t reciprocate either.\n\n-Negative response: When you touch her, she rejects the touch.\nThe most important thing to know about physical touch is this: every time you interact with a girl you like, but you don’t initiate some kind of physicality, you are being rejected.\n\nYes, when you touch a girl you’re taking a risk: she might reject you. But if you never get physical with a girl, you’re not just risking rejection – you’re guaranteeing it.\n\nThe biggest mistake men make when it comes to “kino escalation” is not attempting it in the first place.\n\nPartly, we make this mistake because we don’t want to make women feel uncomfortable. Sure, if you lunge at a girl you just met and try to make out with her, you’ll probably make her uncomfortable. But you can initiate physicality without the risk of creeping her out. \n\nInstead of jumping right into sexual touch, you can start with something less invasive, and gradually build up to the kind of touch that will turn her on.\n\nBefore I give you a step-by-step strategy for using kino escalation to smoothly get sexual with women, it’s important that you know the difference between day game and night game in regards to physicality.\n\n##Kino Escalation: Night Game Vs. Day Game\n\nNightclubs are loud, hectic environments, so it’s not unusual to touch someone you’ve just met there.\n\nFor example, you might put your arm over a girl’s shoulder and lean in close to talk to her (so she can hear you over the music).\n\nOr, if a girl is responding positively to you, you might hold her by the waist or even lean in to kiss her within the first few minutes of the conversation.\n\nThe same isn’t true when meeting women in a casual daytime environment (a university campus, shopping mall). You’re probably not going to whisper into a girl’s ear or grind on her if you’re in a university library.\n\nIf you’re going for a same-day lay, then you should use kino escalation when meeting girls during the day.\n\nHowever, most guys who do day game aren’t attempting to pull girls straight to their bedroom. Most guys go out to a busy street, collect girls’ numbers, set up dates, and then sleep with girls on those dates.\n\nIf you’re new to day game, going for dates is going to be a more effective strategy than going for the same-day lay. And if you’re just going for numbers to set up dates, you don’t need to use any kino escalation when you first meet a girl during the day.\n\nHowever, you will need to use physical touch on the date with her (obviously), and you’ll be able to use the steps below to sexually escalate with women on dates.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##Kino Escalation Step 1: Break The Touch Barrier\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe first step of making an interaction with a woman physical should be non-invasive. There are two simple ways to do this:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**1. When the girl you’re talking to says something you like, touch her on the shoulder as a way of showing approval.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou shouldn’t leave your hand on her shoulder for more than a few seconds. Touching a girl’s shoulder isn’t particularly intimate, but it’s an effective way to break the touch barrier.\n\nImportant to note, you can’t expect a girl to reciprocate this particular type of touch. This is the one instance where you should treat a neutral response the same as a positive response: so long as she doesn’t reject your touch, you can take that as a green light to escalate further.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**2. You can hold a girl’s hand when taking her from one place to another**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs a general rule, you should lead a girl to different locations. For example, if you meet a girl on the street, you might invite her to get a cup of coffee with you. Or, if you meet a girl at a club, you might invite her to talk in the outside area. \n\nWhen you invite a girl to do this, you can hold her by the hand to lead her. I used to think hand holding is fairly intimate and some women would reject me when offering my hand. To my surprise, this move almost always gets a positive response.\n\nHolding a girl’s hand is a simple – yet effective – way to introduce physicality in your interaction with a girl.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##Kino Escalation Step 2: Building Sexual Tension\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn the first step, you’re breaking the touch barrier with a girl in a non-invasive way. Once you’ve done that, the second step of “kino escalation” is to touch a girl in a way that actually turns her on.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**1: Hold Her By Her Waist**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPutting your arms around a girl’s waist will create powerful sexual tension with a girl.\n\nThis technique is particularly useful if you’re nervous to lean in for the kiss. If a girl responds positively when you hold her by her waist, you can be fairly confident that she’ll be receptive to kissing you.\n\nIn a nightclub or bar you can use the loudness of the club as an excuse to hold a girl by the waist. If you’ve been talking to a girl for a few minutes, and she was okay with you touching her shoulder or holding her hand, you can gently put your hands on or around her waist to establish some intimacy with her.\n\nDon’t overthink this move, there is no exact right moment to physically escalate. Generally, if a girl likes you and is comfortable with you, she’ll be glad to let you hold her by the waist. As soon as your intuition tells you the girl likes you, go for it.\n\nYour first attempts at holding a girl by her waist might be a bit stilted. Worst case scenario, you’ll make her a bit uncomfortable and she’ll reject your touch. That’s fine, it’s part of the learning process. Once you’ve gotten used to this type of physical escalation, you’ll get consistently positive results with it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**2: Dance with her**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNaturally, dancing isn’t something you’ll do in all environments – but it’s a great way to arouse a girl in a nightclub. If you’ve been talking to a girl in a nightclub and she seems to like you, invite her to dance with you.\n\nSimply say something like, “Hey, let’s go to the dancefloor for a minute.” Then, grab her by the hand (don’t wait for her to say yes, assume the yes unless she says no).\n\nDancing with a girl in a club isn’t complicated. The most important rule is that you don’t half ass it. Don’t dance with three feet of space between you and the girl to leave room for the holy spirit. Dance with her.\n\nYour body should be against hers. You should feel her every movement.\n\nUsually, when I dance with a girl we start by dancing front to front (you can place one of your legs between her legs to, um, increase stimulation). Then, at some point, I’ll turn her around so we can grind.\n\nYou don’t have to be a technically skilled dancer to turn a girl on – just follow the beat and let your instincts take over.\n\nIf you dance with a girl and it’s awkward, it’s probably not because your a bad dancer, it’s because you’re uncomfortable and that’s making the girl uncomfortable. The solution to this is to keep dancing with girls in clubs until you become confident in your abilities.\n\n&nbsp; \n\n**3: Make Out With Her**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHow do you know when to lean in for a kiss? Two things:\n\n-She responded positively to your touch previously.\n-She holds eye contact with you for more than 3 seconds - (alternatively, she looks at your lips).\n \n9 times out of ten, if the above criteria are met, a girl will respond positively when you lean in to kiss her. In most cases, women won’t hold strong eye contact with you if they don’t want you to make a move – because they know strong eye contact is very invitational.\n\nTo be fair, some girls won’t hold strong eye contact when they want you to kiss them. But the vast majority will.\n\nIf a girl doesn’t hold strong eye contact with you, but she is receptive to your physicality and seems to be interested in you, she might just be uncomfortable with getting physical in public – lead her somewhere with more privacy, and see if she responds differently.\n\nAs for how to actually lean in for the kiss. Just lean in. There’s no magic formula, no special technique – just lean towards her. If she likes you, she’ll probably kiss you back. If she doesn’t, she’ll dodge your kiss. That might be awkward, but honestly, it’s better to get rejected for a kiss than it is to wonder what might have happened if you made a move.\n\n&nbsp; \n\n##Kino Escalation Step 3: Sex\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe final step of “kino escalation” is, of course, sex.\n\nWhen you’ve got a girl in a bed with you, your first goal is to get her so aroused that she’s practically begging to have you deep inside of her.\n\nThere’s a million ways to turn a girl on when she’s in your bed. Here’s a 4-step method I’ve found to be highly effective:\n\nMake out with her. This one’s self-explanatory for the most part. \n\nKiss her neck. I’ve yet to meet a woman who isn’t aroused by being kissed on the neck. Use this generously.\n\nBrush your hands around her inner thighs. Gradually move inwards until you’re essentially fingering (but outside her pants).\n\nAt some point, unbutton her pants, and finger her through her panties. Then, finger her below her panties. Do this generously enough that she becomes overwhelmed with desire.\n\nOnce you’ve done all the above steps, she should be ready and excited to have you fuck her, hard. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n##Wrapping Up Kino Escalation: How To Attract Women With Physical Touch\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe purpose of game, in general, is to make a girl receptive to your sexual escalation. The more charming, sexually confident, bold, and calibrated you become, the more likely the girls you meet will be responsive to your touch.\n\nUnfortunately, many guys learn how to make their personalities attractive to women, but they never get physical with the girls they approach.\n\nWhy is this?\n\nBecause they don’t try.\n\nAnd, I get it. Touching a girl can be intimidating, she could reject you.\n\nRemember, though, there’s no alternative. If you like a girl, and you don’t physically escalate in some way, you missed an opportunity. The only way to know for sure whether a girl likes you is to make a move.\n\nUsing the “escalation ladder” you learned in this article can make this daunting task easier. Instead of just leaning in to kiss a girl, you can build up to it gradually by first touching her shoulder (or holding hand), then holding her by the hips (or dancing with her), and finally, leaning in for the kiss.\n\nIf I think back through my life, there have been hundreds of times where my instincts told me a girl liked me, but I hesitated to touch her, and as a result, nothing ever happened with her. I have to wonder what kind of relationships I might have had if I didn’t hesitate so many times to make a move.\n\nMost men miss countless opportunities with women because they never make a real move. Use what you’ve learned in this article to stop missing opportunities, and to start having sexual adventures with beautiful women.\n\n*You can follow me on Snapchat to see daily infield footage (approaches, pulls, etc.) Username: AveryGHayden*\n","author_fullname":"t2_1478ef","saved":true,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Kino Escalation: How To Attract Women With Physical Touch","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/seduction","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_9xs54q","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":152,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":null,"can_mod_post":false,"score":152,"approved_by":null,"thumbnail":"self","edited":1542434281,"author_flair_css_class":null,"steward_reports":[],"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1542445630,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.seduction","allow_live_comments":true,"selftext_html":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Kino escalation is the process of touching a girl in an increasingly intimate way until you sleep with her.</p>\n\n<p>Physical touch is important because it&#39;s the primary difference between a friendly interaction and a sexual interaction.</p>\n\n<p>In this article, you’re going to learn a fool-proof strategy for bringing physical touch into your interactions with women.

The only way to know for sure whether a girl likes you is to make a move.</p>\n\n<p>Using the “escalation ladder” you learned in this article can make this daunting task easier. Instead of just leaning in to kiss a girl, you can build up to it gradually by first touching her shoulder (or holding hand), then holding her by the hips (or dancing with her), and finally, leaning in for the kiss.</p>\n\n<p>If I think back through my life, there have been hundreds of times where my instincts told me a girl liked me, but I hesitated to touch her, and as a result, nothing ever happened with her. I have to wonder what kind of relationships I might have had if I didn’t hesitate so many times to make a move.</p>\n\n<p>Most men miss countless opportunities with women because they never make a real move. Use what you’ve learned in this article to stop missing opportunities, and to start having sexual adventures with beautiful women.</p>\n\n<p><em>You can follow me on Snapchat to see daily infield footage (approaches, pulls, etc.) Username: AveryGHayden</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":true,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/ZGR1sg-vUSAQWAqAxfv4BMJr0Qm4XK5Hqfv4RFK2SWA.jpg?auto=webp&s=2a969e091fa129ba43e8d35c7c7da2f1921bc632","width":1280,"height":720},"resolutions":[{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/ZGR1sg-vUSAQWAqAxfv4BMJr0Qm4XK5Hqfv4RFK2SWA.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=2ef67af59f5a6e1d73c88a55f30f79e3753a3e84","width":108,"height":60},{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/ZGR1sg-vUSAQWAqAxfv4BMJr0Qm4XK5Hqfv4RFK2SWA.jpg?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=815580e2f9e5fb978ea65ed69d61b49c8b87a6b3","width":216,"height":121},{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/ZGR1sg-vUSAQWAqAxfv4BMJr0Qm4XK5Hqfv4RFK2SWA.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=3f9f3cef66d102a46ec529f67504a88cda1aea99","width":320,"height":180},{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/ZGR1sg-vUSAQWAqAxfv4BMJr0Qm4XK5Hqfv4RFK2SWA.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=769e37be9cd65137180faa092e9626dd85e9085c","width":640,"height":360},{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/ZGR1sg-vUSAQWAqAxfv4BMJr0Qm4XK5Hqfv4RFK2SWA.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=ec33388ce06cb3a81e08812c5ac45ed3089744c7","width":960,"height":540},{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/ZGR1sg-vUSAQWAqAxfv4BMJr0Qm4XK5Hqfv4RFK2SWA.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=4436e2174b40f0b252ff5d8ed3dde05cf06127c5","width":1080,"height":607}],"variants":{},"id":"UNHVV_8r-WcW6kDgnrpGy7aRu9VxXsiH2Iy66d-IhtQ"}],"enabled":false},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"visited":false,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qhrv","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"9xs54q","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Aghayden","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":19,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/seduction/comments/9xs54q/kino_escalation_how_to_attract_women_with/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/9xs54q/kino_escalation_how_to_attract_women_with/","subreddit_subscribers":413989,"created_utc":1542416830,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"comments":[]}];
